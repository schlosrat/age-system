## Spaceship and Vehicle Controls
You can drag and drop Characters to Veihcles and Spaceships, so these passengers will be able to be selected for roles inside the vehicle/spaceship. **However, this will only work for vehicles/spaceships when opened a character sheet directly from directory or from a token with LINKED ACTORS option selected**.
When opening a sheet from an *Unlinked Token*:
- **Spaceships:** Passengers section will vanish, roles will assigned automatically to spaceship **Crew**.
- **Vehicles:** Passengers section will vanish, and the Conductor role will be "Token" - which means you must select a Token on canvas and them click the Dice icon to roll a maneuver. Note: in the future, spaceships will also have this option.

## Shortcuts
1. *Shift + Click* on Attack or Damage rolls trigger GM roll (only GM can see).
2. *CTRL + Click* on Damage rolls adds +1D6 to the total.
3. *CTRL + ALT + Click* on Damage rolls adds +2D6 to the total.
4. *ALT + Click* on Attack, Focus, Ability or Damage rolls to add Roll Options.
5. *Right Click* on Focus in the character sheet opens a context menu with options to roll it with another Ability, show on Chat, edit and delete.
6. *Drag and drop* a owned Weapon or owned Power to macrobar to create a macro.

## Modifiers
A few items have a "Modificators" section. Modificatores will only apply when the item is equiped/activated (i.e., **shield icon** in character sheet without opacity).
The checkbox must be checked to have the mod active in the item.
Bonuses for maneuvers are on top of the normal bonuses granted by the maneuver.
